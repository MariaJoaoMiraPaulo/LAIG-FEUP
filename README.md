### Project 3

The aim was create a 3D environment developed in WebGL to represent a board game programmed using prolog language and make use of a game interface [dat.gui](https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/). The game is named Blockade.


>Players each have 2 pawns and 7 walls. Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 3x3 squares in on each of the four corners of the 10x9 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area. Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.
